    <h2>Diversity Matters!</h2>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} is committed to creating a conference that is as inclusive as possible.
        We want to showcase talent available around our local community and welcome international submissions as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are also committed to ensuring the conference is a place
        where ideas are exchanged, old friends get together, new friends meet and <strong>harassment
        is not tolerated</strong>. We expect speakers, attendees and sponsor representatives to be
        professional and courteous to each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund,
        ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise) who is unable to adhere to this policy.
